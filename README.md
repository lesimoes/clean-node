# clean-node

A CLI tool to scan and list all `node_modules` directories starting from the current working directory. It shows the full path, last modification date, and total size of each directory â€” ideal for identifying and cleaning up unused dependencies.

```bash
clean-node
```

## ðŸ“¦ Example output

```bash
ðŸ“¦ [1] /Users/user/Projects/api/node_modules
   ðŸ•’ Last modified: 04/04/2025 12:32:10

ðŸ“¦ [2] /Users/user/Projects/site/node_modules
   ðŸ•’ Last modified: 03/04/2025 09:10:47
```

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Node.js 18 or newer

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This tool does not delete any folders â€” it only scans and reports.

Made because I'm tired of forgotten node_modules eating up disk space. 

* Possible in future I'll add delete feature.
